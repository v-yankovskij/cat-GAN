# cat-GAN

This repository contains GAN, generating cat images.
It was implemented in autumn 2020 according to [this tutorial](https://debuggercafe.com/implementing-deep-convolutional-gan-with-pytorch/) to celebrate my first acquaintance with the concept of Generative Adversarial Networks. 
It was trained on [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/cat-dataset).

There are two files in this repository:

`cat_preprocessor.ipynb` contains code for preprocessing the images in the dataset.

`cat_GAN.ipynb` contains the implementation of the GAN.
